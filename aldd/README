This directory contains the work that I have done or am doing for the 
Advanced Linux Device Drivers course offered by UC Santa Cruz extension
in Santa Clara. I took this course Winter term, 2013. 
The sub-directories A1, A2 and A3 relate to homework assignments and the
PCI-PROJECT subdirectory contains...well, the work I am doing for the project.
