This directory contains the work that I have done for the 
Advanced Linux Device Drivers course offered by UC Santa Cruz extension
in Santa Clara. I took this course Winter term, 2013. 

The sub-directories A1, A2 and A3 relate to homework assignments and the
rtl8139 subdirectory contains work that I did for the project - a kernel 
module device driver for the RealTek RTL8139 ethernet chip.
