in the first phase of the project, we are to address the basic PCI portion
of the driver. I have have to admit taking inspiration from the in-tree
driver, '8139cp.c'. 

This portion was developed and tested on an old Pentium 4 based desktop 
machine running Debian 6 with my own custom configured and built kernel. 
It works! (developed, compiled and tested on kernel version 3.0.68)

8139bks.c:  my basic PCI driver for a generic PCI ethernet card based 
            upon the RealTek RTL8139D chip. 

8139regs.c: is not my code at all. it is a handy module that dumps many of
            the io registers on the rtl8139.
