This directory contains a device driver that I am implementing for the class
project. The driver supports a generic PCI ethernet NIC card based upon the
RealTek 8139D chip. This chip was chosen based upon availability of the 
manufacturer's data sheet. The card was purchased on Amazon.com (~$10.00).
The device driver is being developed in two phases. 
In the first phase of the project, we are to address the basic PCI portion
of the driver. I have have to admit taking inspiration from the in-tree
driver, '8139cp.c'. 

Results of the first phase: It works! and makes a lot of noise in the log.

This driver was developed and tested on a couple of old Pentium 4 based
desktop machines. Both are running Debian 6 with my own custom configured
and built kernel (Linux-3.0.68).
