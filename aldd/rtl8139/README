This directory contains a device driver that I am implementing for the class
project. The driver supports a generic PCI ethernet NIC card based upon the
RealTek 8139D chip. This chip was chosen based upon availability of the 
manufacturer's data sheet. The card was purchased on Amazon.com (~$10.00).
The device driver is being developed in two phases. 
In the first phase of the project, we are to address the basic PCI portion
of the driver. I have have to admit taking considerable inspiration from the
in-tree driver, '8139too.c'. 

This driver was developed and tested on a couple of old Pentium 4 based
desktop machines. Both are running Debian 6 with my own custom configured
and built kernel (Linux-3.0.68). 

Results of the first phase: It works! and makes a lot of noise in the log.

Results of the second phase: When the port is connected to a router, and 
the module is inserted, the interface does DHCP and gets an address. 
It still is not fully working - there are many, many Rx Buffer Overflow 
interrrupts.Also note that I've only tested this after removing the 
8139too driver...which maybe initializing the card for me before I 
rmmod that driver and insmod mine.

transcript: a transcript of the bash shell when testing the driver
            it provides some evidence of what I typed on the command 
            line and what happened during a brief build & test run.

           documented in the transcript.
