Brad Selbrede, 7 March 2013

Assignment #3 deals with the mmap file ops method and also, to a lesser extent,
this assignment emphasizes the difference between memory areas allocated by 
kmalloc and those allocated by vmalloc. 

The tar file includes the source files, a Makefile and a source file for a 
quick-and-dirty demo program. The following files are also included...

transcript : a file that captures what was typed on the console by the
leading upto and including several test runs of the demo program.

dmesg.out : a copy of the output from the dmesg program taken shortly after 
the test runs shown in the transcript. 

README : this file.
