Assignment #2
Advanced Linux Device Drivers, Winter 2013
UCSC-extension

The files in this tar ball constitute my work for assignment #2. 

In addition to a simple characteer device driver, there are a pair of user land
programs. One sets the blink frequency and the other sets the blink pattern. 
Each of these take a single, integer command line argument. Omitting the 
argument results in the current value of blink frequency or blink pattern to 
be returned. 

The make file builds both of these user land programs as well as the kernel
module. 

Each blink pattern number corresponds to a particular pattern as follows:
1) blinks the scroll lock LED only
2) blinks the caps lock LED only
3) blinks both the scroll lock and caps lock LEDs 
4) blinks the num lock LED only.
5) blinks the num lock and the scroll lock LEDs
6) blinks num lock and caps lock
7) blinks all three
8) pattern is a binary counter, scroll lock is the lsb and num lock is the msb
9) similar to pattern 8 except that the sequence is: 0->4->2->1->3->5->6->7->0

There are also some plain text files that show sample runs.
The file 'transcript' shows the user console from the test run. The file, 
'dmesg.txt' is a copy of the output from the dmesg command shortly after
the test run documented in the transcript file.
