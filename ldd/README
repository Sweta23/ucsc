I took the Linux Device Drivers class at UC SantaCruz extension during the 
Summer quarter of 2012. Raghav Vinjamuri was the instructor and although
I enrolled in an online section of the course, I occassionally also attended 
class sessions of an on campus section of the course offered during a roughly
overlapping time period. However, I live a long way from the Santa Clara campus
and so, for the most part, preferred to work entirely from home.

This directory contains the work I did for assignments in that class.
