I took the Linux Device Drivers class at UC SantaCruz extension during the 
Summer quarter of 2012. Raghav Vinjamuri was the instructor and although
I enrolled in an online section of the course, an on campus section of the 
course was offered during a roughly overlapping time period. I attended a few
of the on campus sessions but, for the most part, perferred to work entirely 
from home (I live a long way from the Santa Clara campus). 
This directory contains the work I did for assignments in that class.
