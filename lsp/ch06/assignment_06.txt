Excercises:
6.1 Modify "mysh" (from chapter 5) to include commands "wc", "cat" and "ls"
    from previous chapter(s), as built-in commands. Each is in a different 
    file ( .c and .o )
--- I actually did this in the prev. lesson

6.2 Create a static or dynamic library for these commands.
--- a static lib containing cat.o, ls.o and wc.o is created by the makefile.

6.3 Create a man page for "mysh" stating the builtin commands. Test it.
--- the man page is in file "mysh.1"

6.4 Create a makefile to re-create lib archive, or the executable "mysh" as
    appropriate. Test it.
--- done.

6.5 Create an rpm for "mysh"


6.6 Modify your makefile to add a make rule for creating an rpm for "mysh".
    Test it.
