Homework assignment #8 
The assignment this week was to add support for long command line options 
and also add a second way for the two processes to communicate. The new 
method is to use SysV IPC. 

I added support for long comman dline options and did the ground work for 
the second part but, since there is just one week left of class and I've
done quite a bit of prior work with SysV message Queues and Shared memory,
I am going to skip ahead to the last two Homework assignements - which involve
socket communication. This way, I learn more and get more out of the course. 
If time permits I will come back and provide an implementationof the main loop
that uses SysV IPC.
