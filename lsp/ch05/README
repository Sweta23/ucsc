In assignment #5, we continue to develop our own shell program. This time we
are to integrate our versions of the wc, ls and cat commands from previous 
assignments and make these  "built-in" commands in our shell.  The assinment
also requres that the input have a timeout of fifteen seconds. 
I used the poll() function to implement the timeout on stdin. I wasn't 
sure what to do in case of a timeout so, it simply prints an informatave
message and prints anew prompt. Bailing out of the shell might also be an 
appropriate response to timeout.
