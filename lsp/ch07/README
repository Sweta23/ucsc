In this homework assignmnet the shell is split into a client and a server.
The client and server communicate over a pipe. This communication is one-way
from client to server. The user will interact with the client process via
the standard input and output streams, which will normally be associated with 
a terminal so, the clinet process will be the parent of the server.

The division of labor is as follows: 

Client:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. start the server
1. output a prompt string
2. read one line of input
3. pass the line of input to the server.
4. wait (with a timeout) for a response from the server.
5. if response from server is received before the time out expires and is 
   non-negative, repeat steps 1-4. Otherwise exit cleanly.


Server:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. gets started by the client
1. wait for a line of input from the client.
2. process the input.
3. send a response to the client 
4. repeat step 1-3 

Note that the normal exit happens when the user input is either "exit" or 
"quit". In which case, the server responds to the client with a NACK and 
then terminates cleanly.
