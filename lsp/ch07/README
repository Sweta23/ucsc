In this homework assignmnet the shell is split into a client and a server.
The client and server communicate over a pipe. This communication is one-way
from client to server. The user will interact with the client process via
the standard input and output streams, which will normally be associated with 
a terminal so, the clinet process will be the parent of the server.

The division of labor is as follows: 

Client:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. starts the server
1. output a prompt string
2. read one line of input
3. break up the input string into individual tokens. 
4. pass token list to the server.
5. wait some short period of time for the server to respond.
6. print the response from the server to the stadard output.
7. repeat steps 1-6


Server:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. gets started by the client
