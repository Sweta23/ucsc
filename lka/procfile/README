This directory contains code for a simple linux kernel module that demonstrates
how to use the proc file sysem to provide information to user space. 

To compile this module, simply do make in this directory. 
Inserting the module creates a file in the the proc file system named '/proc/bks'.
User land can read this file by simply issuing the command, 'cat /proc/bks'.
The file contains very basic information about the location, in kernel memory,
of an array of struct page. The size of this array is also reported. 

This module writes some information about its state and usage to the syslog. 
This information can be viewed by issuing the command, 'dmesg'.
